    <h1>Description</h1>
    
    <p>
      Let's all admit: Cookies are a great snack for any time of the day. For my
      preference, I usually have at least 2 cookies paired with a glass of milk.
      I prefer my cookies a bit big, with a crunchy outer and a soft yet chewy
      inner. Just thinking about it makes me want to make one for myself!

      Note: These steps are based from the popular recipe uploaded on the

    <ol>
      <li>
        Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars
        together until very light, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the
        vanilla. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients and mix until just
        combined, 5 to 10 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drop chocolate pieces in and incorporate them without breaking them.
        Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72
        hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop 6 3Â½-ounce mounds of dough (the size of generous golf balls) onto
        baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that
        are poking up; it will make for a more attractive cookie.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake until golden brown but still
        soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer sheet to a wire rack for 10 minutes,
        then slip cookies onto another rack to cool a bit more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking
        remaining batches the next day. Eat warm, with a big napkin.
      </li>
