    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      Brownies are my all time favorite dessert food that I would gladly eat at
      a normal day. I prefer a crispy outer shell with a fudgy inner shell. It's
      perfect to pair with a glass of milk.

      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish with cooking
        spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.

        sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.

        In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.

        Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the batter into the prepared pan and use a spatula to smooth the
        top.
      </li>

        Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a
        few crumbs attached.
