      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>
        Brownies are my all time favorite dessert food that I would gladly eat
        at a normal day. I prefer a crispy outer shell with a fudgy inner shell.
        It's perfect to pair with a glass of milk.

      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish with
          cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment
          paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered
          sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and
          vanilla.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the batter into the prepared pan and use a spatula to smooth the
          top.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a
          few crumbs attached.
        </li>
        <li>Cool completely before slicing.</li>
