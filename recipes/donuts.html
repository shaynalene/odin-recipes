    <p>

      Note: These steps are based from the popular recipe uploaded on the
      internet.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, add milk, sugar, yeast, crack an egg and whisk it well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add all purpose flour and salt. Mi it again until it becomes dough in
        texture. Add softened butter and mix it to the dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer dough into a kneading table and oil/dust your hand (It will be
        sticky but no need to add extra flour). Knead the dough for about 10
        minutes. Stop kneading once it becomes elastic when stretched with
        fingers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently, turn it around on the table to form into a round shape until the
        top becomes smooth and round.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare a glass bowl, add some oil, and transfer the dough. Turn it
        around to coat with oil. Cover the bowl with cling wrap and let it proof
        for an hour until doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        After proofing, gently punch down the dough 4 times to release all the
        air. Dust the table with flour, oil your hands and rolling pin. Spread
        out the dough with the rolling pin. And cut the dough using a round
        metal cutter for each donut (or you may use a cup). Repeat the same for
        the remaining dough. Then just shape the remaining small dough into
        balls and flatten with palm
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into 35 grams balls and place it on individually cut
        round baking paper. Transfer it on the baking sheet and cover with cling
        wrap. Let it rest again for 20-30 minutes until half inflated.
      </li>
      <li>
        About 10-15 minutes before frying, remove the cover of the dough. So the
        outer surface of the dough becomes a bit dry. This will help reduce oil
        absorption when frying.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a frying pan, heat the oil on a medium-low heat, add the donuts one
        by one with the liner (don’t go back and forth). Then remove each liner
        from the oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wait until the bottom of each donut is light brown then flip it over.
        Once donuts are cooked evenly, remove and drain. Let it cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a pastry bag with ½” round tip (or just use a squeezable ketchup
        plastic bottle). Fill each donut with your chosen filling. Then use a
        strainer or sprinkle duster with bianca snow powder. Alternatively for
        home consumption, you may use your favorite sugar. You may also use any
        sugar like: bakers donut sugar, confectioners sugar, granulated sugar.
